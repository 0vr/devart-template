# Project Title
X-Ray Arcade

## Authors
- George Mylonas - 0vr

## Description
When I pick upa controller I feel as though I am picking up an organ. I want to translate that feeling into the creation of a mini-arcade shaped like a creature that will also satisfy my artistic interest in the uncanny (Mike Kelley and Paul McCarthy are certainly inspirational).
